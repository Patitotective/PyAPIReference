- Filter members to include in the tree (by type).
- Customize the color used to display different types in the tree (**color pattern**).
- Convert tree to Markdown (the Markdown will be the API Reference).
- Select the members to include in the Markdown.
- Markdown editor to edit the API Reference.
- Live preview of the Markdown.
- Export the Markdown API Reference as HTML, Markdown or ReStructuredText.
